# Multithread Histogram Generator
 This C++ project implements a solution for analyzing the byte composition of any given file, whether text or binary. By utilizing multithreading, the program computes and displays a histogram of byte frequencies within the file, offering insights into its content structure. There are dual histogram calculation methods: 1) a global histogram approach: all threads contribute to a single, shared histogram, necessitating careful synchronization to prevent race conditions. 2) local histogram approach: Each thread calculates its portion of the histogram independently, with the results merged upon completion, showcasing an alternative strategy to avoid synchronization issues. The project also contains text and binary input files as well as their respective outputs.
